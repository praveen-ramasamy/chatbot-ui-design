# Chatbot UI Design

This project is a simple, responsive chatbot user interface designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It includes a chatbot modal that can be triggered with an icon, and users can send messages by either clicking the "Send" button or pressing the "Enter" key.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The chatbot adjusts to different screen sizes, making it suitable for both mobile and desktop users.
- **Message Sending**: Users can send messages via a button click or by pressing the "Enter" key.
- **Smooth Animations**: The chatbot icon uses a subtle up-and-down animation to catch users' attention.
- **Modal Window**: Chat window opens in a modal popup.
- **Simple Message UI**: Clean design for sender and receiver messages.
- **Promotion Section**: Added links to my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles for further connection and support.
